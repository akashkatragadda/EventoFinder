The app basically helps the user to find events that are close to him based on his taste that we get to know from his profile and his interests. In this app the users can even create an event and help themselves by marketing their events. Apart from all this there is a feature “Want to Work” in which the user can use to apply for working in a certain event which requires casual workers for a couple of days.

This app is aimed towards people who are into attending events on a regular basis and those budding event management companies who want to market their events. This app also helps people volunteer for an event get on field experience and even get paid for it. It should be user-friendly, ‘quick to learn’ and reliable software for the above purposes.
